# Kulturhus-SemesterOppgave
Semesteroppgave Gruppe38, Programutvikling 2019


Assignment in Software development 2019. We created a system for reserving and viewing tickets at a Community center with several venues available. 
The system was supposed to be able to save and load to both Json and csv formats. '
Threads were to be implemented and MVC + Singleton were expected to be used. 
The system had to be able to handle big amounts of data. 
We created a custom generic reader and writer to and from csv format. 
We were required to implement a file chooser, as well as use Maven to structure our project. 
There was minimal focus on GUI in this project other than for it to be functional for the user.
